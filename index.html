<h2>Playing the Retirement Game</h2>
    <p>This is a simple financial simulation of Sal, a salaried person who works 
    from age 20 to 60, then lives a retired life until age 85.</p>
    <p>You are Sal's advisor and advise him a single consistent investment strategy
    for the funds coming from his savings and returns on investments. The allocation strategy will be applied at end of each year; this will also rebalance the portfolio.</p>
    <p>The score is Sal's final inflation-adjusted net worth in mulitples of Sal's annual starting salary. </p>
    <p>If Sal's investements do badly or expenses are more than revenue, Sal's net worth will decrease and may even go negative. Then he has to live off borrowings at 10% interest, and so, subsequently his net worth keeps going more negative every year. Therefore, with bad investement or insufficient savings rate, the final score may be negative.</p>
    <p>There is a random element in returns from debt or equity, so the score will vary across runs. Extremely lucky runs can amass huge net worth.</p>
