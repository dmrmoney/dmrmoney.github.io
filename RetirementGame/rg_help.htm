    <p>This is a simple financial simulation of Sal, a salaried person who works 
    from age 20 to 60, then lives a retired life until age 85.</p>
    <p>You are Sal's advisor and advise him a single consistent investment strategy
    for the funds coming from his savings and returns on investments. The allocation strategy will be applied at end of each year; this will also rebalance the portfolio.</p>
    <p>The score is Sal's final inflation-adjusted net worth in mulitples of Sal's annual starting salary. </p>
    <p>If Sal's investements do badly or expenses are more than revenue, Sal's net worth will decrease and may even go negative. Then he has to live off borrowings at 10% interest, and so, subsequently his net worth keeps going more negative every year. Therefore, with bad investement or insufficient savings rate, the final score may be negative.</p>
    <p>There is a random element in returns from debt or equity, so the score will vary across runs. Extremely lucky runs can amass huge net worth.</p>

        <tr>
        <td>The output is a histogram that puts the individual scores of the N runs into buckets for different score ranges. The height of each bar is the number of runs that fall into that bucket. An ideal strategy would be 
            <ol><li>risk free: no bars in negative score range</li>
                <li>high returns: many tall bars in high score range</li>
            </ol> 
        <p>
        Note: In case of 100% investements into Fixed Deposits, all scores are identical and only a single fat bucket is created.</p></td>
